# Nexus
A Cleaner, Darker Discord interface.


Nexus is a simple theme that uses a material-ish design and reuses the Discord background color variables, not the colors:
`--background-primary`
`--background-secondary`
`--background-tertiary`
`--background-floating`

* Helper plugin for the theme coming soon...
